Galgo
===

This is like a recipe book, but for algorithmists. It contains recipies for
data structures (list, tree, etc) and common algorithms (binary search, merge,
tree traversal, etc), written in Go. It also contains solutions to the problems
I've solved and found interesting.

It is not a library _per see_. It is rather a tool set for mixing and hacking at
maximum coding speed. The typical use case is just copy-pasting some code,
modifying it, submitting the solution and get score. No backward compatibility,
no design patterns, no code reviews, isn't it fun?

Originally I've collected them while solving the HackerRank challenges. I found
that most of the algorithm examples are in C/C++ or Java. As I like Go, I've
ported some of them.

Name Galgo was chosen because it has something in common with "Go" and
"algorithm". And it also nice that [Galgo Espa√±ol][1] is a Spanish greyhound.
